The multicoloured conjecture states, roughly, that a colouring $c$ of the points of $\mathsf{PG}(n-1,q)$ containing no copy of a fixed colouring $c_0$ of $\mathsf{PG}(k-1,q)$ for small $k$ must contain a subspace of dimension polynomial in $n$ that avoids some colour.   If $(k,q) = (2,2)$, then $c_0$ is a colouring of a three-element 'triangle', and there are three essentially different cases, all of which we resolve. We derive both the cases where $c_0$ assigns the same colour to two different elements from a recent breakthrough result in additive combinatorics due to Kelley and Meka. We handle the case that $c_0$ is a 'rainbow' colouring by proving that rainbow-triangle-free colourings of projective geometries are exactly those that admit a certain decomposition into two-coloured pieces.This is closely analogous to a theorem of Gallai on rainbow-triangle-free coloured complete graphs. We also show that existing structure theorems resolve certain two-coloured cases where $(k,q) = (2,3)$, and $(k,q) = (3,2)$.</p><p><span class="label">Why This Matters:</span> This paper introduces a novel geometric perspective to the Erdős-Hajnal conjecture, extending its application from graph theory to finite projective geometries. By resolving cases related to rainbow-triangle-free colorings, it opens up new avenues for understanding combinatorial properties in geometric structures, which is pivotal for the advancement of both discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science.</p><p><span class="label">Categories:</span> math.CO, 05B35, 05C15</p></div><div class="paper"><h3>#2: Extensions of Brown Hamiltonian-I. A high-accuracy model for von   Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations</h3><p><span class="label">Abstract:</span> Triple systems with low hierarchical structure are common throughout the Universe, including examples such as high-altitude lunar satellites influenced by the Earth, planetary satellites perturbed by the Sun, and stellar binaries affected by a supermassive black hole. In these systems, nonlinear perturbations are significant, making classical double-averaged models (even those incorporating the Brown Hamiltonian correction) insufficient for accurately capturing long-term dynamics. To overcome this limitation, the current study develops a high-precision dynamical model that incorporates the nonlinear effects of the quadrupole-order potential arising from both the inner and outer bodies, referred to as the extended Brown Hamiltonian model. This framework specifically expresses the Hamiltonian function and the transformation between mean and osculating orbital elements in elegant, closed forms with respect to the eccentricities of the inner and outer orbits. Practical applications to Jupiter's irregular satellites show that the long-term evolutions predicted by the extended Brown Hamiltonian model align well with the results of direct N-body simulations. The developed Hamiltonian offers a fundamental dynamical model, which is particularly well suited for describing von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations in low-hierarchy three-body systems.</p><p><span class="label">Why This Matters:</span> Develops a high-precision dynamical model for von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations, addressing the limitations of classical models in accurately capturing long-term dynamics of triple systems. This advancement is crucial for astrophysics, enhancing our understanding of celestial mechanics and the evolution of complex stellar systems.</p><p><span class="label">Categories:</span> astro-ph.EP</p></div><div class="paper"><h3>#3: CoIn: Counting the Invisible Reasoning Tokens in Commercial Opaque LLM   APIs</h3><p><span class="label">Abstract:</span> As post-training techniques evolve, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly augmented with structured multi-step reasoning abilities, often optimized through reinforcement learning. These reasoning-enhanced models outperform standard LLMs on complex tasks and now underpin many commercial LLM APIs. However, to protect proprietary behavior and reduce verbosity, providers typically conceal the reasoning traces while returning only the final answer. This opacity introduces a critical transparency gap: users are billed for invisible reasoning tokens, which often account for the majority of the cost, yet have no means to verify their authenticity. This opens the door to token count inflation, where providers may overreport token usage or inject synthetic, low-effort tokens to inflate charges. To address this issue, we propose CoIn, a verification framework that audits both the quantity and semantic validity of hidden tokens. CoIn constructs a verifiable hash tree from token embedding fingerprints to check token counts, and uses embedding-based relevance matching to detect fabricated reasoning content. Experiments demonstrate that CoIn, when deployed as a trusted third-party auditor, can effectively detect token count inflation with a success rate reaching up to 94.7%, showing the strong ability to restore billing transparency in opaque LLM services. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/CASE-Lab-UMD/LLM-Auditing-CoIn.</p><p><span class="label">Why This Matters:</span> Presents a novel framework, CoIn, that introduces transparency into the usage and billing of large language models (LLMs) by verifying the quantity and semantic validity of hidden reasoning tokens. This is significant for the field of AI ethics and governance, proposing a method to ensure fairness and transparency in the commercial use of LLMs.</p><p><span class="label">Categories:</span> cs.AI</p></div><div class="paper"><h3>#4: Sat2Sound: A Unified Framework for Zero-Shot Soundscape Mapping</h3><p><span class="label">Abstract:</span> We present Sat2Sound, a multimodal representation learning framework for soundscape mapping, designed to predict the distribution of sounds at any location on Earth. Existing methods for this task rely on satellite image and paired geotagged audio samples, which often fail to capture the diversity of sound sources at a given location. To address this limitation, we enhance existing datasets by leveraging a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate semantically rich soundscape descriptions for locations depicted in satellite images. Our approach incorporates contrastive learning across audio, audio captions, satellite images, and satellite image captions. We hypothesize that there is a fixed set of soundscape concepts shared across modalities. To this end, we learn a shared codebook of soundscape concepts and represent each sample as a weighted average of these concepts. Sat2Sound achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal retrieval between satellite image and audio on two datasets: GeoSound and SoundingEarth. Additionally, building on Sat2Sound's ability to retrieve detailed soundscape captions, we introduce a novel application: location-based soundscape synthesis, which enables immersive acoustic experiences. Our code and models will be publicly available.</p><p><span class="label">Why This Matters:</span> By leveraging a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for soundscape mapping, this paper significantly advances the field of multimodal representation learning. It not only improves the accuracy of environmental sound prediction but also pioneers the novel application of location-based soundscape synthesis, blending AI's auditory and visual comprehension for environmental sciences.</p><p><span class="label">Categories:</span> cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.SD</p></div><div class="paper"><h3>#5: Convergence Analysis of an Adaptive Nonconforming FEM for Phase-Field   Dependent Topology Optimization in Stokes Flow</h3><p><span class="label">Abstract:</span> In this work, we develop an adaptive nonconforming finite element algorithm for the numerical approximation of phase-field parameterized topology optimization governed by the Stokes system. We employ the conforming linear finite element space to approximate the phase field, and the nonconforming linear finite elements (Crouzeix-Raviart elements) and piecewise constants to approximate the velocity field and the pressure field, respectively. We establish the convergence of the adaptive method, i.e., the sequence of minimizers contains a subsequence that converges to a solution of the first-order optimality system, and the associated subsequence of discrete pressure fields also converges. The analysis relies crucially on a new discrete compactness result of nonconforming linear finite elements over a sequence of adaptively generated meshes. We present numerical results for several examples to illustrate the performance of the algorithm, including a comparison with the uniform refinement strategy.</p><p><span class="label">Why This Matters:</span> This work introduces an adaptive nonconforming finite element method (FEM) for phase-field parameterized topology optimization in Stokes flow, bridging the gap between advanced mathematical techniques and practical engineering applications.

Techniques such as firmware partitioning have been introduced to mitigate this issue, but they frequently fall short, especially in battery-powered systems where time and energy constraints are critical. As a result, physical maintenance interventions are still commonly required, which is costly and inconvenient in large-scale deployments. In this work, we present a lightweight and innovative method that addresses this challenge by generating highly compact delta patches, enabling firmware reconstruction directly on the device. Our algorithm is specifically optimized for low-power devices, minimizing both memory usage and computational overhead. Compared to existing solutions, our approach significantly reduces the data volume needed for updates while maintaining performance comparable to more complex alternatives. Experimental evaluations confirm that our method yields substantial time and energy savings, making it particularly well-suited for battery-powered IoT nodes. Although our implementation targets the LoRaWAN protocol, the approach is flexible and can be adapted to other IoT communication technologies.</p><p><span class="label">Why It's Interesting:</span> This paper proposes a novel strategy, WIND, for accelerating RNN-T inference, introducing a significant improvement in processing speed without compromising accuracy.
